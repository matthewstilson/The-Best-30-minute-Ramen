            I really wanted to create something that was useful to someone. I was struggling to find an idea because everything I wanted 
            to do seemed like it would be to much. 

            I landed on creating a recipe when I came home from school one day and went to cook dinner and could not remeber how I 
            cooked a dish. I spent a while looking for a cookbook only to end up making something different because it was taking to long to 
            find it. 
        </p>
        <p class="text--yellow">
            I decided to do a ramen dish because it is one of my all time favourite things to eat and it was one of the first dishes I made for my wife 
            when we were dating. 
        </p>
        <p class="text--yellow">
            I did some research on ramen and wanted to design the website/inforgraphic styled around Japanese culture.
            I also wanted to create all of my own assets as a recipe would be to easy to accomplish on its own.
        </p>

        <p class="text--yellow">
           I started by writing down and tweaking a recipie to make it more unique. Once I had the recipe down I started to create all of the different icons and 
           assets. The color scheme is centered around all of the different colors of miso paste you can get. I also decided to make a Japanese style 
           SVG for the background that looks like waves or mini red suns iin a classic pattern found in some Japanese art.

       <p class="text--yellow">I created all of the code and assets from scratch. The only thing that I have to source is the recipe that I drew inspiration on.</p>
